# API4AI general image classification / labelling sample

This directory contains a minimalistic sample that sends requests to the API4AI General Classification API.
The sample is implemented in `Swift` using [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession) class.


## Overview

The General Classification API offers a complete solution for image classification. Its algorithm is trained on about a thousand different types of objects covering a significant part of potential image themes from household tools to a wide variety of animals


## Getting started (XCode)

Open `sample.xcodeproj` project in XCode as usual and click "Run".

Optionally you may specify image URL or path to image file as application argument via "Product -> Scheme -> Edit scheme...".


## Getting started (Command line)

Build in Release configuration:
```bash
xcodebuild -scheme sample build -configuration Release SYMROOT=$(PWD)/build
```

Try sample with default args:

```bash
./build/Release/sample
```

Try sample with your local image:

```bash
./build/Release/sample image.jpg
```
